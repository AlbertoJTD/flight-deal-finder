2. Create an account in [Sheety](https://sheety.co/) to access to your Google Sheet file
3. Enable your GET and PUT endpoint in [Sheety](https://sheety.co/) to be able to update the content, [here is the documentation](https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/docs)
4. Create your account at [Tequila](https://tequila.kiwi.com) to access flight information
5. Replace the keys and the endpoint with your own information
